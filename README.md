# ThunderStorage

This project solves the problem of storing data onto the blockchain,
an extremely expensive endeavor. It uses a normal SQL database to load
and store data, but adds in a cryptographic hash published onto the blockchain
to ensure immutability of the data.

At the same time, currently it only allows authorized individuals to save the data
because the operator of this will be paying for all gas fees involved with the
storage.

## Tools

- Typescript
- NestJs
- Typeorm
- Etherjs
- Redoc
